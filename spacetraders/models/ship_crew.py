    Attributes:
        current (int): The current number of crew members on the ship.
        required (int): The minimum number of crew members required to maintain the ship.
        capacity (int): The maximum number of crew members the ship can support.
        rotation (ShipCrewRotation): The rotation of crew shifts. A stricter shift improves the ship's performance. A
            more relaxed shift improves the crew's morale. Default: ShipCrewRotation.STRICT.
        morale (int): A rough measure of the crew's morale. A higher morale means the crew is happier and more
            productive. A lower morale means the ship is more prone to accidents.
        wages (int): The amount of credits per crew member paid per hour. Wages are paid when a ship docks at a
            civilized waypoint.
