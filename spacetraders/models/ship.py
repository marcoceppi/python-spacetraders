    Attributes:
        symbol (str): The globally unique identifier of the ship in the following format: `[AGENT_SYMBOL]_[HEX_ID]`
        registration (ShipRegistration): The public registration information of the ship
        nav (ShipNav): The navigation information of the ship.
        crew (ShipCrew): The ship's crew service and maintain the ship's systems and equipment.
        frame (ShipFrame): The frame of the ship. The frame determines the number of modules and mounting points of the
            ship, as well as base fuel capacity. As the condition of the frame takes more wear, the ship will become more
            sluggish and less maneuverable.
        reactor (ShipReactor): The reactor of the ship. The reactor is responsible for powering the ship's systems and
            weapons.
        engine (ShipEngine): The engine determines how quickly a ship travels between waypoints.
        modules (List['ShipModule']):
        mounts (List['ShipMount']):
        cargo (ShipCargo):
        fuel (ShipFuel): Details of the ship's fuel tanks including how much fuel was consumed during the last transit
            or action.
